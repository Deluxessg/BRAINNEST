<h1>The Minds of Billy Milligan</h1>
<p>"The Minds of Billy Milligan" is a non-fiction book by Daniel Keyes that tells the story of Billy Milligan, a man with multiple personality disorder (now known as dissociative identity disorder). The book explores Milligan's life, from his childhood to his arrest for a series of crimes in the 1970s, and his subsequent trial and treatment.

Milligan's case was one of the first in which multiple personality disorder was successfully used as a defense in a criminal trial. The book provides a detailed account of Milligan's different personalities, or "alters," and the experiences and traumas that led to their creation.

"The Minds of Billy Milligan" is a fascinating and thought-provoking exploration of mental illness and the complexities of human consciousness. It offers a compelling portrait of a unique individual and sheds light on the challenges faced by those who live with dissociative identity disorder.<br>
